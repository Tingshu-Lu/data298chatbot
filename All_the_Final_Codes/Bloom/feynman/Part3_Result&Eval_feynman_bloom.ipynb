There was nowhere to find it. That I knew of. I think it’s just as well. I mean, I suspect — I know now — this has nothing to do with my history, but I suspect, I kind of try to imagine what would have happened to me if I’d lived in today’s era. I’m rather horrified. I think there are too many books, that the mind gets boggled. If I got interested, I would have so many things to look at, I would go crazy. It’s too easy. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this is just an old fashioned point of view. You know. There’s always these things. But it does bother me a little bit that there’s so many things, and it’s so easy, and they’re watering down. The thing that I loved was, everything that I read was serious, was absolutely — wasn’t written for a child. I have never read anything that was written for a child except THE BOY SCIENTIST book, which was pretty good. But the things written for children, after a certain stage, by let’s say high school stage or even the late, late era in grammar school — things written for a child were not good. Very rarely, things written for a child — there were books on the cave man, you know? Cave men living, and people who lived on trees, and there was a book with a series of families in different circumstances that I found interesting. That was obvious for children. But later on, children’s things — I didn’t like children’s things. Because, for one thing I was very very — (and still am) — sensitive and very worried about was that the thing to be dead honest; that it isn’t fixed up so it looks easy. It isn’t fixed up and partly faked so that the explanation can be made more simply — for the child, you know? Details purposely left out, or slightly erroneous explanations, in order to get away with it. This was intolerable. So I ultimately had only to trust the completely mature and odd old things, even though I was only in high school. I think most kids in high school are very mature. Because I know my friends who were in literature — you know, who wrote — and my friends who wrote plays, and they would read the great plays. They wouldn’t read the children’s plays, you know.

I had this laboratory, which. I told you about, when I was in grammar school, and by the time I was in high school I still had it, and it was developing further. And I would repair radios in the neighborhood, to make a little money, to get the money to buy junk for my laboratories. I had a photo-electric cell. I made amplifiers — not good ones. Nothing really worked well for me, but I struggled with it. I had lab banks and voltages and batteries and old radios and motors and so on. Electrical stuff. It had really developed from a chemistry laboratory to an electrical laboratory. Now, in this business, I had read in one of my friend’s (Bernie Walker’s) books, some years back — what year I can’t remember exactly — he had one of these, BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE or some book. But there were a number of other books that interested me. It might be interesting. One of the books that interested me very much was a book called THE BOY SCIENTIST, by A.

What I’m telling you now is not what I feel now about the problems. I remember definitely not liking the second problem, and thinking the first problem was a wonderful problem, and the second problem was not so wonderful. Not that it was easier, but I had a taste, as you say, as to what I liked. Yeah. I remember distinctly the idea, I discussed it with my friend, that there’s only five numbers, and what the hell, there’s five angles, you might as well work out each one separately and give the five angles in a list and you’ve done the whole problem.

I did like this laboratory very much. I worked all the time. I connected the whole house up with wires to my lab, so that I could plug in with my earphones to my radio upstairs, anywhere in the house. Then I used that system in many ways. I would also pipe power down, and you could put a loudspeaker somewhere in the house, and go upstairs and broadcast from it, and all this kind of stuff. I found a way to connect into the radio, and so on.

I had had a chemistry set even earlier, when I was in Far Rockaway, in another house which I have forgotten now. My father gave it to me for a birthday present, or somebody gave it to me for a present — the earliest one. What happened to the earliest one was, it was too early. I played around with a little bit, and a lot of the kids from the neighborhood came, and I showed them the chemistry set. They were big boys, and they took the thing outside, while I stood more or less helplessly by, and they mixed everything with everything else and poured it on the sidewalk and tried to put a match to it. I stood far back, because I was afraid it would explode. It was full of water, of course, it wouldn’t explode. But I still remember that it was brownish and made bubbles, when you mixed everything together. But that was not the way I thought to do things. This, to me, was a kind of destruction. This was not the thing that a chemistry set was good for. You see, I never played that way. I never played chaotically with scientific things. I realized that their real value was in doing something carefully and watching what happened, and it was real pleasure. It was worth it. And this other stuff was just a terrible, silly way to behave. But anyway, I was too young then to want another set or to do anything with it. In those days I just played. But in Cedarhurst is when consciously the science really developed, until I was doing a lot of things.', 'type': 'Document'}]   \n","29

Do you remember what the father of that family did for a living?\\nA: He had a man. What did he do for a living at that time, the father? I don’t know. He worked in a shirt business for a while. My knowledge now is that the situation in the family was that my mother’s sister was a very superior woman, full of intellect, liked plays and reading, and that she married a man whom she thought was of her intellectual height, you know, and so on. But he was a rather dullish, uninteresting, not very able man. So rather than his developing for her a fine home, with the finances and so on, they had troubles, and he had always relatively mundane jobs in shirt factories, or maybe as head of shipping in a shirt business or something of this kind. So there was a certain problem there. I think both of the mother’s married — didn’t have too good financial luck.

There was nowhere to find it. That I knew of. I think it’s just as well. I mean, I suspect — I know now — this has nothing to do with my history, but I suspect, I kind of try to imagine what would have happened to me if I’d lived in today’s era. I’m rather horrified. I think there are too many books, that the mind gets boggled. If I got interested, I would have so many things to look at, I would go crazy. It’s too easy. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this is just an old fashioned point of view. You know. There’s always these things. But it does bother me a little bit that there’s so many things, and it’s so easy, and they’re watering down. The thing that I loved was, everything that I read was serious, was absolutely — wasn’t written for a child. I have never read anything that was written for a child except THE BOY SCIENTIST book, which was pretty good. But the things written for children, after a certain stage, by let’s say high school stage or even the late, late era in grammar school — things written for a child were not good. Very rarely, things written for a child — there were books on the cave man, you know? Cave men living, and people who lived on trees, and there was a book with a series of families in different circumstances that I found interesting. That was obvious for children. But later on, children’s things — I didn’t like children’s things. Because, for one thing I was very very — (and still am) — sensitive and very worried about was that the thing to be dead honest; that it isn’t fixed up so it looks easy. It isn’t fixed up and partly faked so that the explanation can be made more simply — for the child, you know? Details purposely left out, or slightly erroneous explanations, in order to get away with it. This was intolerable. So I ultimately had only to trust the completely mature and odd old things, even though I was only in high school. I think most kids in high school are very mature. Because I know my friends who were in literature — you know, who wrote — and my friends who wrote plays, and they would read the great plays. They wouldn’t read the children’s plays, you know. It’s the same thing.

I had this laboratory, which. I told you about, when I was in grammar school, and by the time I was in high school I still had it, and it was developing further. And I would repair radios in the neighborhood, to make a little money, to get the money to buy junk for my laboratories. I had a photo-electric cell. I made amplifiers — not good ones. Nothing really worked well for me, but I struggled with it. I had lab banks and voltages and batteries and old radios and motors and so on. Electrical stuff. It had really developed from a chemistry laboratory to an electrical laboratory. Now, in this business, I had read in one of my friend’s (Bernie Walker’s) books, some years back — what year I can’t remember exactly — he had one of these, BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE or some book. But there were a number of other books that interested me. It might be interesting. One of the books that interested me very much was a book called THE BOY SCIENTIST, by A.

My father gave it to me for a birthday present, or somebody gave it to me for a present — the earliest one. What happened to the earliest one was, it was too early. I played around with a little bit, and a lot of the kids from the neighborhood came, and I showed them the chemistry set. They were big boys, and they took the thing outside, while I stood more or less helplessly by, and they mixed everything with everything else and poured it on the sidewalk and tried to put a match to it. I stood far back, because I was afraid it would explode. It was full of water, of course, it wouldn’t explode. But I still remember that it was brownish and made bubbles, when you mixed everything together. But that was not the way I thought to do things. This, to me, was a kind of destruction. This was not the thing that a chemistry set was good for. You see, I never played that way. I never played chaotically with scientific things. I realized that their real value was in doing something carefully and watching what happened, and it was real pleasure. It was worth it. And this other stuff was just a terrible, silly way to behave.

So rather than his developing for her a fine home, with the finances and so on, they had troubles, and he had always relatively mundane jobs in shirt factories, or maybe as head of shipping in a shirt business or something of this kind.

I had had a chemistry set even earlier, when I was in Far Rockaway, in another house which I have forgotten now. My father gave it to me for a birthday present, or somebody gave it to me for a present \\u2014 the earliest one. What happened to the earliest one was, it was too early. I played around with a little bit, and a lot of the kids from the neighborhood came, and I showed them the chemistry set. They were big boys, and they took the thing outside, while I stood more or less helplessly by, and they mixed everything with everything else and poured it on the sidewalk and tried to put a match to it. I stood far back, because I was afraid it would explode. It was full of water, of course, it wouldn\\u2019t explode. But I still remember that it was brownish and made bubbles, when you mixed everything together. But that was not the way I thought to do things. This, to me, was a kind of destruction. This was not the thing that a chemistry set was good for. You see, I never played that way. I never played chaotically with scientific things. I realized that their real value was in doing something carefully and watching what happened, and it was real pleasure. It was worth it. And this other stuff was just a terrible, silly way to behave. But anyway, I was too young then to want another set or to do anything with it. In those days I just played. But in Cedarhurst is when consciously the science really developed, until I was doing a lot of things.', 'type': 'Document'}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

  [{'id': None, 'metadata': {}, 'page_content': 'Q: So there’s no consistent poring through scientific libraries.\\nA: No, no. There was nowhere to find it. That I knew of. I think it’s just as well. I mean, I suspect — I know now — this has nothing to do with my history, but I suspect, I kind of try to imagine what would have happened to me if I’d lived in today’s era. I’m rather horrified. I think there are too many books, that the mind gets boggled. If I got interested, I would have so many things to look at, I would go crazy. It’s too easy. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this is just an old fashioned point of view. You know. There’s always these things. But it does bother me a little bit that there’s so many things, and it’s so easy, and they’re watering down. The thing that I loved was, everything that I read was serious, was absolutely — wasn’t written for a child. I have never read anything that was written for a child except THE BOY SCIENTIST book, which was pretty good. But the things written for children, after a certain stage, by let’s say high school stage or even the late, late era in grammar school — things written for a child were not good. Very rarely, things written for a child — there were books on the cave man, you know? Cave men living, and people who lived on trees, and there was a book with a series of families in different circumstances that I found interesting. That was obvious for children. But later on, children’s things — I didn’t like children’s things. Because, for one thing I was very very — (and still am) — sensitive and very worried about was that the thing to be dead honest; that it isn’t fixed up so it looks easy. It isn’t fixed up and partly faked so that the explanation can be made more simply — for the child, you know? Details purposely left out, or slightly erroneous explanations, in order to get away with it. This was intolerable. So I ultimately had only to trust the completely mature and odd old things, even though I was only in high school. I think most kids in high school are very mature.

I had this laboratory, which. I told you about, when I was in grammar school, and by the time I was in high school I still had it, and it was developing further. And I would repair radios in the neighborhood, to make a little money, to get the money to buy junk for my laboratories. I had a photo-electric cell. I made amplifiers — not good ones. Nothing really worked well for me, but I struggled with it. I had lab banks and voltages and batteries and old radios and motors and so on. Electrical stuff. It had really developed from a chemistry laboratory to an electrical laboratory. Now, in this business, I had read in one of my friend’s (Bernie Walker’s) books, some years back — what year I can’t remember exactly — he had one of these, BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE or some book. But there were a number of other books that interested me. It might be interesting. One of the books that interested me very much was a book called THE BOY SCIENTIST, by A.

There was nowhere to find it. That I knew of. I think it’s just as well. I mean, I suspect — I know now — this has nothing to do with my history, but I suspect, I kind of try to imagine what would have happened to me if I’d lived in today’s era. I’m rather horrified. I think there are too many books, that the mind gets boggled. If I got interested, I would have so many things to look at, I would go crazy. It’s too easy. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe this is just an old fashioned point of view. You know. There’s always these things. But it does bother me a little bit that there’s so many things, and it’s so easy, and they’re watering down. The thing that I loved was, everything that I read was serious, was absolutely — wasn’t written for a child. I have never read anything that was written for a child except THE BOY SCIENTIST book, which was pretty good. But the things written for children, after a certain stage, by let’s say high school stage or even the late, late era in grammar school — things written for a child were not good. Very rarely, things written for a child — there were books on the cave man, you know? Cave men living, and people who lived on trees, and there was a book with a series of families in different circumstances that I found interesting. That was obvious for children. But later on, children’s things — I didn’t like children’s things. Because, for one thing I was very very — (and still am) — sensitive and very worried about was that the thing to be dead honest; that it isn’t fixed up so it looks easy. It isn’t fixed up and partly faked so that the explanation can be made more simply — for the child, you know? Details purposely left out, or slightly erroneous explanations, in order to get away with it. This was intolerable. So I ultimately had only to trust the completely mature and odd old things, even though I was only in high school. I think most kids in high school are very mature.

But the things written for children, after a certain stage, by let\\u2019s say high school stage or even the late, late era in grammar school \\u2014 things written for a child were not good. Very rarely, things written for a child \\u2014 there were books on the cave man, you know? Cave men living, and people who lived on trees, and there was a book with a series of families in different circumstances that I found interesting. That was obvious for children. But later on, children\\u2019s things \\u2014 I didn\\u2019t like children\\u2019s things. Because, for one thing I was very very \\u2014 (and still am) \\u2014 sensitive and very worried about was that the thing to be dead honest; that it isn\\u2019t fixed up so it looks easy. It isn\\u2019t fixed up and partly faked so that the explanation can be made more simply \\u2014 for the child, you know? Details purposely left out, or slightly erroneous explanations, in order to get away with it. This was intolerable. So I ultimately had only to trust the completely mature and odd old things, even though I was only in high school. I think most kids in high school are very mature.
