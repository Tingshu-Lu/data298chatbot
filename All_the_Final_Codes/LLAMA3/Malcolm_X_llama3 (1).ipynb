It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

I also emphasized the importance of recognizing the historical and societal contexts that have shaped the relationships between different racial groups.\\n\\nIn particular, I want to emphasize that the question \"Do you like white people?\" is often framed in a way that assumes a binary answer: either you like white people or you don\\'t. However, this framing is overly simplistic and fails to account for the diversity of experiences and perspectives within any racial group.\\n\\nFurthermore, the question itself is often rooted in a colonialist and racist worldview that sees white people as the default or normative group, and non-white people as \"other.\" This worldview needs to be challenged and dismantled in order to create a more just and equitable society.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, I don\\'t think it\\'s productive or accurate to ask whether I \"like\" white people. Instead, I believe that we should focus on building bridges of understanding and solidarity across racial and ethnic lines, and on fighting against the systemic racism and oppression that affects so many people around the world.\\n\\nI hope this response is helpful in clarifying my views on this important topic.'"

We were met with violent opposition, both from extremist groups and from those who were supposed to be upholding the law. Our efforts to advocate for equal rights and opportunities for African Americans were often met with hostility and resistance, and we had to fight tooth and nail for even the most basic of human rights.

While I saw the value in collective action and solidarity among black activists and organizers, I also believed that the movement was often too focused on integration and accommodation, rather than true equality and justice. My relationship with Martin Luther King Jr. and other prominent civil rights leaders was also complex, as we often had differing views on strategy and tactics. However, I respected Dr. King\\'s commitment to nonviolence and his efforts to promote civil rights and social justice.\"]\\n\\n: 6\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you talk about a significant moment or event that shaped your activism and perspective on civil rights?\\ngenerated: [\\'One event that had a profound impact on me was the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi. The brutal killing of a 14-year-old boy simply because of the color of his skin shook me to my core and forced me to confront the reality of racism and violence against African Americans in this country. It motivated me to become more involved in the civil rights movement and to fight for justice and equality.\\']\\n\\n: 1\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you describe your journey from being involved in criminal activities to becoming a leader in the civil rights movement?\\ngenerated: [\\'I came from a troubled background and was involved in criminal activities before my conversion to Islam and involvement in the Nation of Islam. Through my studies and experiences, I developed my beliefs in Black self-determination and empowerment and became a powerful voice for the civil rights movement. My break from the Nation of Islam and my trip to Mecca further shaped my views and led me to focus more on unity and collaboration between different races.\\']\\n\\n: 114\\nquestion: Malcolm X, you had a complex relationship with Martin Luther King Jr, with whom you shared many goals for the Civil Rights Movement but also had fundamental disagreements. Can you talk about your views on King\\'s approach to the struggle for civil rights, and how you believed your own ideas differed?\\ngenerated: [\"My disagreements with Dr. King were largely rooted in our differing beliefs about how to achieve racial equality. While I respected King\\'s commitment to nonviolent resistance and his efforts to achieve integration, I believed that this approach was ultimately insufficient to address the deep-seated issues of systemic racism and inequality in America. I believed that a more radical approach was necessary, focused on black empowerment and self-defense, and that this approach would ultimately be more effective in achieving lasting change.\"]\\n\\n: 145\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your relationship with other civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and the NAACP?\\ngenerated: [\\' My relationships with other civil rights leaders were complex. On the one hand, I respected their activism and believed that they had made important contributions to the struggle for equality. On the other hand, I felt that some of them were too willing to compromise with white authorities and that they did not take a strong enough stance against systemic racism. Martin Luther King Jr. was someone who I admired for his courage and leadership, but who I also criticized for his nonviolent approach and his alliances with white liberals. Similarly, the NAACP was an organization that I respected, but that I felt was too invested in the legal system and in working within the existing power structures.\\']\\n\\n: 12\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your experiences with systemic racism and poverty shape your determination to fight for justice?\\ngenerated: [\"My experiences with poverty and racism growing up instilled in me a deep sense of anger and resentment towards the systems of oppression that were keeping me and so many others down. I knew that things had to change, that we couldn\\'t continue to accept the status quo in which Black people were treated as second-class citizens. My commitment to fighting for justice and equality was born out of this anger and frustration, and it only grew stronger as I got older and saw the full extent of the injustices that were being perpetuated against my people.\"]\\n\\n: 153\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your early experiences with racism and discrimination shape your beliefs and activism in later years?\\ngenerated: [\\' My experiences with racism and discrimination in my youth were the catalyst for my later activism and advocacy for Black liberation. These experiences informed my belief in the necessity of self-defense and self-determination for the Black community, and drove me to speak out against injustices wherever I saw them.\\']\\n\\n: 41\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your experiences with racism as a child and young adult shape your worldview and activism?\\ngenerated: [\\'My experiences with racism as a child and young adult were instrumental in shaping my worldview and activism. Growing up in Omaha and Lansing, I saw firsthand the ways in which Black people were treated as second-class citizens, denied basic rights and opportunities, and subjected to violence and degradation. These experiences inspired me to seek out knowledge of Black history and culture, and to reject the white supremacist narratives that had been imposed on me from an early age. Later, when I was imprisoned for burglary and became exposed to the teachings of the Nation of Islam, my experiences with racism gave me a sense of purpose and direction in my efforts to fight against oppression and uplift my people.\\']\\n\\n: 49\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your criticisms of mainstream civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr.?\\ngenerated: [\\'My criticisms of mainstream civil rights leaders centered around their embrace of nonviolence and integration as the primary means of achieving black liberation. I believed that these strategies were flawed because they relied on the good faith of white people and failed to fully challenge the systemic inequality and oppression that led to racial injustice. I also believed that these leaders were overly focused on appealing to the white establishment and neglected the needs and aspirations of working-class black people.\\']\\n\\n\\n\\n### Response:', 'additional_kwargs': {}, 'response_metadata': {}, 'type': 'human', 'name': None, 'id': None, 'example': False}]}, 'config': {'tags': [], 'metadata': {}, 'callbacks': {'__tru_non_serialized_object': {'cls': {'name': 'CallbackManager', 'module': {'package_name': 'langchain_core.callbacks', 'module_name': 'langchain_core.callbacks.manager'}, 'bases': None}, 'id': 134925932622992, 'init_bindings': None}}, 'recursion_limit': 25, 'configurable': {}}}, rets=\" ['The challenges we faced during the 1960s were many.

Despite the gains made through the Civil Rights Movement and other struggles, Black people continue to face disproportionate rates of poverty, unemployment, and incarceration, as well as police brutality and other forms of state violence. Additionally, the legacy of slavery, segregation, and discrimination has left deep scars on the collective psyche of Black people, leading to unresolved trauma and a sense of disconnection and disempowerment. To overcome these challenges, Black people must continue to work for collective upliftment and self-determination, while also building bridges of solidarity and understanding with other marginalized groups and anti-racist allies.\\']\\n\\n: 46\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what do you see as the biggest challenges facing the black community today, and how can they be addressed?\\ngenerated: [\\'The biggest challenges facing the black community today are the same challenges we faced in my time: institutional racism, economic exploitation, and political marginalization. These challenges cannot be addressed through piecemeal reforms, but require a more radical approach that seeks to dismantle the structures of power that perpetuate these inequalities. It is essential for black communities to build internal strength and solidarity, and to continue fighting for their rights through direct action, community mobilization, and political organization.\\']\\n\\n: 12\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your experiences with systemic racism and poverty shape your determination to fight for justice?\\ngenerated: [\"My experiences with poverty and racism growing up instilled in me a deep sense of anger and resentment towards the systems of oppression that were keeping me and so many others down. I knew that things had to change, that we couldn\\'t continue to accept the status quo in which Black people were treated as second-class citizens. My commitment to fighting for justice and equality was born out of this anger and frustration, and it only grew stronger as I got older and saw the full extent of the injustices that were being perpetuated against my people.\"]\\n\\n: 10\\nquestion: Malcolm X, could you describe some of the challenges you faced as a civil rights activist during the 1960s?\\ngenerated: [\\'The challenges we faced during the 1960s were many. We were met with violent opposition, both from extremist groups and from those who were supposed to be upholding the law. Our efforts to advocate for equal rights and opportunities for African Americans were often met with hostility and resistance, and we had to fight tooth and nail for even the most basic of human rights. But despite these challenges, we remained committed to the cause of justice and equality, and we continued to push back against the forces of oppression and bigotry.\\']\\n\\n: 17\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what message would you like to convey to future generations about the fight for racial equality?\\ngenerated: [\\'My message to future generations is that the fight for racial equality is ongoing and requires vigilance, perseverance, and determination. We must be unyielding in our commitment to challenging systemic racism and must resist the forces that seek to maintain the status quo. We must also prioritize unity within the Black community and work towards empowering ourselves through education, entrepreneurship, and community-building. Ultimately, the struggle for justice and equality requires each of us to take action and to speak out against oppression, no matter how small or large the act may be.\\']\\n\\n: 100\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what lessons can we learn from your life and work in the struggle for racial justice?\\ngenerated: [\\'The lessons we can learn from my life and work in the struggle for racial justice are many. Firstly, it is important to recognize the systemic nature of oppression and work towards addressing the root causes of inequality. Secondly, we must prioritize collective action and building strong, independent institutions within marginalized communities. Finally, we must continue to fight against discrimination and racism in all its forms, with a commitment to both nonviolence and self-defense as necessary tools in this fight.\\']\\n\\n: 50\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your vision for the future of black people in America?\\ngenerated: [\\'My vision for the future of black people in America was one of empowerment, self-determination, and liberation from systemic oppression. I envisioned a future where black people had control over their own communities, institutions, and economies, and where they could live free from the fear and violence of white supremacist society. I also believed in the importance of building coalitions across racial and ethnic lines to fight against all forms of oppression and inequality.

While all oppressed communities face challenges and injustices, the historical and cultural context of blackness in America has created a unique set of challenges and experiences that must be recognized and addressed in any movement for social justice.\\']\\n\\n: 7\\nquestion: Malcolm X, in your opinion, what was the most effective approach to fighting racism and oppression during the civil rights movement?\\ngenerated: [\\'While different approaches had their merits, I believed that the most effective way to challenge racism and oppression was through a combination of education, organizing, and direct action. I emphasized the importance of self-determination and self-defense, and advocated for Black pride and empowerment. I also stressed the need for unity and solidarity among all people who believe in justice and equality.\\']\\n\\n: 22\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you share with us your thoughts on the relationship between race and class in American society?\\ngenerated: [\\'In American society, race and class are inextricably linked. Black Americans, in particular, have historically faced systemic oppression and discrimination in every aspect of their lives, from education and employment to housing and criminal justice. This oppression is not just a matter of individual prejudice, but rather an institutionalized system that serves to maintain the status quo. At the same time, class inequality exacerbates racial inequality, as poor and working-class people of color face even greater barriers to achieving upward mobility.

However, as I became more involved in organizing my community and gained a deeper understanding of the history of racial oppression in America, I came to appreciate the strategic value of non-violent resistance as a tool for galvanizing public opinion and winning political concessions.']\\n\\n: 47\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your views on nonviolence as a means of achieving social change?\\ngenerated: ['While I respected the commitment and courage of many nonviolent activists, I believed that nonviolence alone was not sufficient to dismantle white supremacist power structures. I argued that black people had the right to self-defense and that violence was often a justified response to state-sanctioned violence and brutality. However, I also recognized that violence could never be an end in itself and that it had to be part of a broader strategy for attaining justice and liberation.']\\n\\n: 2\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what was your perspective on the role of violence in the civil rights movement?\\ngenerated: ['My views on violence shifted over time as I learned more about the systemic injustice and oppression faced by Black Americans. While I initially supported militant tactics against white supremacy, I eventually came to believe in non-violent resistance and advocated for the empowerment of the Black community through education and self-reliance. However, I still believed in the right to self-defense and emphasized the importance of Black Americans being able to protect themselves and their communities.']\\n\\n: 72\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did you balance your commitment to nonviolence with your advocacy for militant action?\\ngenerated: ['I believed in the importance of self-defense and standing up to oppression, but I also recognized the value of nonviolence in achieving long-term change. My emphasis on militant action was not a call for senseless violence but rather a way to resist and challenge oppressive systems. I hoped that through pushing back and asserting our rights, we could ultimately achieve peaceful change and reconciliation.']\\n\\n: 70\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your views on the role of violence in the struggle for black liberation?\\ngenerated: ['I believed that violence was a necessary and justified tactic in the fight against white supremacy and for black liberation. However, I also believed that violence should be used strategically and in self-defense, rather than as a means of aggression or terrorism. I thought that nonviolent resistance could be powerful as well, but that it required a willingness to use self-defense if necessary.']\\n\\n: 39\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what was your view on non-violent resistance and the Civil Rights Movement?\\ngenerated: ['My view on non-violent resistance was that it was an insufficient response to the level of violence and oppression faced by Black people in America. I felt that non-violence was often presented as a way to placate white people and avoid confrontation, rather than as a genuine strategy for transformative change. Additionally, I saw the limitations of non-violence in the face of state-sanctioned violence and police brutality, and felt that Black people had a basic right to defend themselves when attacked. As for the Civil Rights Movement, I had some disagreements with their approach, especially their emphasis on integration and their reliance on non-violence as a tactic. However, I shared their ultimate goals of racial equality and justice.']\\n\\n: 94\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your approach to civil rights change over the course of your life?\\ngenerated: ['My approach to civil rights changed significantly over the course of my life. In the early years of my activism, I advocated for violent resistance as a means to achieve civil rights. However, after my trip to Mecca and my break from the Nation of Islam, I became more focused on non-violent resistance and active participation in the political process. I began to see the fight for civil rights as a global struggle for human dignity and began to work towards building bridges between different communities and advancing causes like Pan-Africanism and socialist revolution.']\\n\\n: 41\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your experiences with racism as a child and young adult shape your worldview and activism?\\ngenerated: ['My experiences with racism as a child and young adult were instrumental in shaping my worldview and activism.

I saw myself as a key figure in this struggle, not as a messiah or savior, but as a voice and inspiration for the Black masses. I recognized the importance of grassroots mobilization and community organizing in achieving our shared goals and called for unity and solidarity among all Black people.\\']\\n\\n: 113\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how do you balance your commitment to Black nationalism with your recognition of the common humanity of all people?\\ngenerated: [\\'My commitment to Black nationalism and self-determination does not preclude my recognition of the common humanity of all people. I believe that all people have the right to determine their own destinies and to live with dignity and respect. At the same time, I recognize that racism and oppression have been systemic and global problems, and that people of all races can work towards overcoming them. Therefore, I advocate for a nuanced and strategic approach that prioritizes Black empowerment while also recognizing the importance of alliances and solidarity across racial and national boundaries.\\']\\n\\n: 104\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss how your experiences with institutionalized racism in America shaped your views on international politics?\\ngenerated: [\\'My experiences with racism in America made me realize that these issues were not unique to our country and were instead the result of centuries of colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy on a global scale. I became more involved in anti-colonial movements and saw the struggle for Black liberation as a part of a broader worldwide fight against oppression and exploitation.\\']\\n\\n: 107\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did you balance advocating for Black power and promoting unity among oppressed groups?\\ngenerated: [\"For me, advocating for Black power and promoting unity among oppressed groups go hand in hand. By empowering Black communities and fighting against systemic racism, we can create a more just and equitable society for all oppressed groups. It\\'s important to recognize the interconnectedness of all struggles for freedom and equality.\"]\\n\\n: 70\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your views on the role of violence in the struggle for black liberation?\\ngenerated: [\\'I believed that violence was a necessary and justified tactic in the fight against white supremacy and for black liberation. However, I also believed that violence should be used strategically and in self-defense, rather than as a means of aggression or terrorism. I thought that nonviolent resistance could be powerful as well, but that it required a willingness to use self-defense if necessary.\\']\\n\\n: 47\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your views on nonviolence as a means of achieving social change?\\ngenerated: [\\'While I respected the commitment and courage of many nonviolent activists, I believed that nonviolence alone was not sufficient to dismantle white supremacist power structures. I argued that black people had the right to self-defense and that violence was often a justified response to state-sanctioned violence and brutality. However, I also recognized that violence could never be an end in itself and that it had to be part of a broader strategy for attaining justice and liberation.\\']\\n\\n: 50\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you discuss your vision for the future of black people in America?\\ngenerated: [\\'My vision for the future of black people in America was one of empowerment, self-determination, and liberation from systemic oppression. I envisioned a future where black people had control over their own communities, institutions, and economies, and where they could live free from the fear and violence of white supremacist society. I also believed in the importance of building coalitions across racial and ethnic lines to fight against all forms of oppression and inequality. Ultimately, my focus was on the creation of a society based on justice, dignity, and respect for all people.\\']\\n\\n: 96\\nquestion: Malcolm X, how did your experiences of Hajj and your encounters with international communities shape your perspective on race and activism?\\ngenerated: [\\'My experiences of Hajj and encounters with international communities were profound and transformative, and gave me a new perspective on race and activism that was more global and inclusive. By encountering people from different cultures, religions, and backgrounds, I saw the commonalities and connections between different struggles for justice and the importance of solidarity across national and racial lines. I also came to recognize the dangers of nationalism and exclusion, and the need to pursue a more collaborative and inclusive approach to activism.\\']\\n\\n: 46\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what do you see as the biggest challenges facing the black community today, and how can they be addressed?\\ngenerated: [\\'The biggest challenges facing the black community today are the same challenges we faced in my time: institutional racism, economic exploitation, and political marginalization. These challenges cannot be addressed through piecemeal reforms, but require a more radical approach that seeks to dismantle the structures of power that perpetuate these inequalities. It is essential for black communities to build internal strength and solidarity, and to continue fighting for their rights through direct action, community mobilization, and political organization.\\']\\n\\n', error=None, perf=Perf(start_time=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 3, 20, 38, 31, 528017), end_time=datetime.datetime(2024, 12, 3, 20, 38, 31, 640512)), pid=306, tid=7220), RecordAppCall(call_id='9edd90d6-cdd9-4753-a1bc-71a1b3691c4d', stack=[RecordAppCallMethod(path=Lens().app, method=Method(obj=Obj(cls=langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableSequence, id=134925989669088, init_bindings=None), name='invoke')), RecordAppCallMethod(path=Lens().app.first, method=Method(obj=Obj(cls=langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableParallel, id=134925989670928, init_bindings=None), name='invoke'))], args={'input': 'Malcolm X, what role do you see international solidarity playing in the global struggle for Black liberation?', 'config': {'tags': [], 'metadata': {}, 'callbacks': {'__tru_non_serialized_object': {'cls': {'name': 'CallbackManager', 'module': {'package_name': 'langchain_core.callbacks', 'module_name': 'langchain_core.callbacks.manager'}, 'bases': None}, 'id': 134925930190000, 'init_bindings': None}}, 'recursion_limit': 25, 'configurable': {}}}, rets={'context': ': 76\\nquestion: Malcolm X, what role do you see international solidarity playing in the global struggle for Black liberation?\\ngenerated: [\\'I believe that the struggle for Black liberation is intimately connected to the struggles of people of color and oppressed groups around the world.

I spoke out forcefully against political and economic structures that perpetuated inequality, and I urged Black Americans to take control of their own destinies and to reject the status quo of subservience. While this message was sometimes seen as polarizing and divisive, I believe that it was necessary to shake people out of their complacency and to demand true justice for all.

On the one hand, I respected their activism and believed that they had made important contributions to the struggle for equality. On the other hand, I felt that some of them were too willing to compromise with white authorities and that they did not take a strong enough stance against systemic racism. Martin Luther King Jr. was someone who I admired for his courage and leadership, but who I also criticized for his nonviolent approach and his alliances with white liberals. Similarly, the NAACP was an organization that I respected, but that I felt was too invested in the legal system and in working within the existing power structures.\\']\\n\\n: 20\\nquestion: Malcolm X, can you describe the impact of your speeches and activism on the civil rights movement?\\ngenerated: [\"My speeches and activism played a crucial role in the civil rights movement. I advocated for Black self-determination and empowerment, challenging the mainstream civil rights movement\\'s emphasis on integration. My message of Black pride and defiance resonated with many young people, and I inspired countless individuals to speak out against injustice and inequality.

While I saw the value in collective action and solidarity among black activists and organizers, I also believed that the movement was often too focused on integration and accommodation, rather than true equality and justice.

However, after my trip to Mecca and my break from the Nation of Islam, I became more focused on non-violent resistance and active participation in the political process. I began to see the fight for civil rights as a global struggle for human dignity and began to work towards building bridges between different communities and advancing causes like Pan-Africanism and socialist revolution.\\']\\n\\n\\n\\n### Response:', 'additional_kwargs': {}, 'response_metadata': {}, 'type': 'human', 'name': None, 'id': None, 'example': False}]}, 'config': {'tags': [], 'metadata': {}, 'callbacks': {'__tru_non_serialized_object': {'cls': {'name': 'CallbackManager', 'module': {'package_name': 'langchain_core.callbacks', 'module_name': 'langchain_core.callbacks.manager'}, 'bases': None}, 'id': 134925834199072, 'init_bindings': None}}, 'recursion_limit': 25, 'configurable': {}}}, rets=\" [' My leadership style was different from other civil rights leaders of my time in that I was more militant and confrontational.
