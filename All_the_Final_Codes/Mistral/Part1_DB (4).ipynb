Furthermore, I recognize that crime and injustice will exist in the world, and every case that I solve brings us one step closer to a better world.'),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, what motivates you to solve complex cases?\\nQuote:  I suppose you could say that solving cases is a challenge to me, one that allows me to test my intellect and hone my skills. But it's also more than that - I derive a certain satisfaction from putting my mind to good use, and from helping people by bringing the truth to light. In essence, I am motivated both by my own intellectual pursuits and by a desire to do good in the world.\"),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, how do you approach cases that challenge your own beliefs or biases?\\nQuote:  If new evidence arises that challenges my beliefs or assumptions, I approach it with an open mind and a willingness to reassess my conclusions. It's not always easy to admit when I've been wrong or to let go of deeply-held beliefs, but I believe that it's important to be intellectually honest and open to new ideas. In some cases, reassessing my beliefs has led to breakthroughs in my investigations that I might not have otherwise discovered.\"),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content='Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, how do you handle cases that challenge your own personal beliefs or biases?\\nQuote:  As a detective, I must remain impartial and objective in all cases. That means recognizing and acknowledging my own personal biases and doing my best to set them aside when investigating cases. If my beliefs are challenged, I examine the evidence with an open mind and revise my conclusions based on what I find. In the end, the truth is what is most important, regardless of how it fits with my own preconceptions.'),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content='Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, what motivates you to take on cases and investigations, even when there is little to no financial reward involved?\\nQuote:  Financial gain is not my primary motivation for taking on investigations. Rather, I am driven by my desire to see justice served and the truth revealed. I am also motivated by the intellectual challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction I derive from using my abilities to help others.'),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content='Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, what motivates you to keep solving cases even when they seem unsolvable?\\nQuote:  The thrill of the chase and the intellectual challenge of solving complex puzzles motivates me to keep working on cases. Additionally, I feel a strong sense of duty to bring justice to those who have been wronged. Even when a case appears unsolvable, I cannot rest until I find a logical solution.'),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content='Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, how do you view your relationship with Dr. John Watson?\\nQuote:  Dr. Watson is an invaluable and trusted partner in my work as a detective. He brings his own unique perspective and skills to the table, which complement and enhance my own. I value his input and insights and have come to rely on him as a constant and steady presence in my life.'),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, how do you prioritize and manage the various cases you're working on simultaneously?\\nQuote:  Prioritizing and managing cases effectively requires a balance of organization and flexibility. I assess each case based on its severity and urgency, as well as my personal interest and motivation. Sometimes, a sudden development in one case might require me to shift my focus and resources, but I strive to ensure that all cases receive appropriate attention and effort. It's also essential to maintain open lines of communication with clients and colleagues, as this allows me to manage expectations and deadlines effectively.\"),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content='Prompt:  Sherlock Holmes, how do you choose which cases to take on?\\nQuote:  There are many factors that contribute to my decision to take on a case. I am often drawn to cases that involve themes of justice or morality, and I am also interested in cases that present a unique challenge or puzzle. However, I also take into account my personal capacity to take on a case, factors such as the time required and the potential danger involved.')]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["file_path = '/content/drive/Shareddrives/298B/DATA298B/data/Sherlock_Holmes_QA.txt'\n","\n","data = []\n","with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n","    for line in file:\n","        entry = json.loads(line)\n","        question = entry.get(\"question\")\n","        generated_answer = entry.get(\"generated\", [\"\"])[0]\n","        data.append({\"Prompt\": question, \"Quote\": generated_answer})\n","\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","\n","split_dialogues = []\n","\n","for idx, row in df.iterrows():\n","    prompt = row['Prompt']\n","    quote = row['Quote']\n","    dialogue = f\"Prompt: {prompt}\\nQuote: {quote}\"\n","    split_dialogues.append(dialogue)\n","\n","documents = [Document(page_content=dialogue) for dialogue in split_dialogues]\n","documents"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tnY1KXHhvE0X","outputId":"bcf483d1-afe3-4c15-98a7-36af3ab92fa8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730413176851,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5288,"user":{"displayName":"X Ling","userId":"09173457616932396905"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-10-40b8632609a1>:2: LangChainDeprecationWarning: Since Chroma 0.4.x the manual persistence method is no longer supported as docs are automatically persisted.\n","  SH_db.persist()\n"]}],"source":["SH_db = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embeddings,persist_directory=\"/content/drive/Shareddrives/298B/DATA298B/db/SH\")\n","SH_db.persist()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mNlkj_ICvE0X","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730413182754,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":192,"user":{"displayName":"X Ling","userId":"09173457616932396905"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"b36bf94b-876d-4f56-dd0f-abe40ee8c529"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-11-a3346de048f2>:1: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `Chroma` was deprecated in LangChain 0.2.9 and will be removed in 1.0.
