              " 'EM: Yeah, I mean even before there were supply chain issues, Tesla demand exceeded production. So now its demand is exceeding production to a ridiculous degree. We’re actually probably going to limit that. Just stop taking orders for anything beyond a certain period of time because some of the timing is like a year away. So anyway, the frustration that we’re seeing with customers is being unable to get them a car, not are they willing or interested in, buying a car? So basically, I think zero about demand generation and a lot about production, and engineering and supply chain.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Yeah, Sure. So, I mean, I think there’s still a lot of things that need to get done before this deal concludes. Obviously there’s not yet even been a shareholder vote and Twitter has not yet filed the proxy for a shareholder vote. So there are still some outstanding questions that need to be resolved. And so it is certainly not a done deal. That just objectively it is not a done deal. You know, the best-case scenario is that this would be, I think, perhaps done in two or three months.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: I think there’s a general question of truth. There’s a general question around this: should Twitter have permanent bans. And, you know, I’ve talked with Jack Dorsey about this and he and I are of the same mind, which is that permanent bans should be extremely rare and really reserved for people where they’re trying for accounts that are bots or spam, scam accounts, where there is just no legitimacy to the account at all. I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump. I do think that was a mistake because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice. He is now going to be on Truth Social as will a large part of the right in the United States. So I think this could end up being frankly worse than a single forum where everyone could debate.\\n',\n",

And this is the point that I am trying to make, which is perhaps not getting across:banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice. It will amplify it among the right, and this is why it is morally wrong and flat out stupid.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Yes, well, this is not a forum for announcing new products, new Tesla products. The 20 million by 2030 is an aspiration, not a promise. And the reason for aiming for something like that is there are approximately 2 billion cars and trucks in the world. And for us to really make a dent in sustainable energy and electrification. I think we need to replace at least 1 per cent of the fleet per year to really be meaningful, and that’s where the 20 million units comes from. Let’s try to replace 1 per cent of the global fleet of 2 billion cars and trucks per year and that’s our aspiration. It’s not a promise, it’s an aspiration. I think we’ve got a good chance of getting there. And people will see based on the products that we unveil, they’ll be able to judge for themselves whether that goal is realistic or not.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: We have an incredible team at Tesla and executing very well and our annual growth rates are faster than any large manufacturer product in the history of Earth. But I think the next fastest was the growth of the Model T and we’re faster than Model T. So, you know, if that growth rate continues, then obviously we will reach 20 million vehicles a year, but we may stumble and not reach that goal. So, it’s roughly equally difficult to have gotten to this point, as will be to get to 20 million.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: There are some raw material constraints that we see coming. In lithium production, probably in about three years and in cathode production. Cathode, the two main cathode choices are nickel and iron phosphate. Obviously iron is extremely plentiful, but both is 32 per cent higher by composition. So, little bit of trivia if someone says what is Earth made of? The single biggest element that Earth is made of is iron. The second biggest element that Earth is made of is oxygen, which is about 30 per cent of Earth’s mass. So clearly iron’s not in short supply. The phosphate is slightly more of a challenge, but still quite common. So I do not see any fundamental scaling constraints and lithium is also quite common. Lithium is practically everywhere. So this is not a question of a shortage, as though some rare element it’s really just that the lithium mining and especially the refining capacity, and that of the taking iron and phosphorus and turning it into battery grade iron phosphate, or nickel and turning it into battery grade nickel it’s really the equipment. I think the single biggest constraint would be the equipment necessary to convert the ore into battery grade materials.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Yes, I think you’re sort of putting too much emphasis on those 20 million vehicles by 2030 as though this is some grand promise, of some hill upon which we will die. It is simply an aspiration. And we may achieve it, we may not. Our goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy and so that’s why we want to make a lot of cars and also a lot of stationary battery packs because the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are: electric transport, stationary battery packs, and solar and wind and geothermal and hydro basically sustainable energy sources. With solar and wind, particularly are intermittent, and so you need stationary battery packs to store the energy when the sun doesn’t shine.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: I think that we’ve not succeeded in the goal. If you consider the goal to be getting the automotive industry to move strongly towards electric vehicles. I think that part of the goal, we have succeeded in, and that was explicitly part of our goal to get the industry moving towards electric vehicles because they were doing nothing in that direction when we started. And for the longest time, they were dismissing the concept of electric vehicles. And then Tesla started taking market share away from them. And that changed their mind.\\n',\n",

Then, SpaceX is about extending life beyond Earth too so that we may become a multiplanetary species and with Starlink, providing internet coverage to the least served in the world.\\n',\n",

              " 'EM: Yeah, I was certainly asked many times by the government of China to do a factory in China. So we were not going to do one which is 51 per cent locally owned. And so if they’re willing to change the rules, not just for us, but for everyone, then we would move forward. And so they did. And I think it’s been very successful so far, and the government’s very happy about it and I know things are proceeding fairly well.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Well, we’re not expecting to open any additional plants in China in the near future. We will be expanding our Shanghai factory but our focus on production is going to be on the two new factories that we’ve recently completed in Berlin and Austin, Texas.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Yes, I would say that self driving is one of those things where there are a lot of old stones or you know where you think you’re getting there. But then you end up asymptoting and your progress is initially linear and then it looks logarithmic and sort of tapers off because you’re at a local maximum that you did not realise you were in. Now at this point, I think we are no longer trapped in a local maximum. And obviously, I could be wrong but I think we are actually quite close to achieving self driving at a safety level that is better than human. And it appears like your best guess is that we’ll get there this year. But we’re really not far from it. And like I said, the best way to assess this is to be in our beta programme or look at the videos of those who are in the beta programme and look at the progress that has occurred and the progress is dramatic. And I’m confident we will not really get to the safety level of human will get far in excess of the safety level of human. So I think ultimately probably a factor of 10 safer than a human as measured by the probability of injury.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Well, it is important to note that and we’ve never said ever, that the Tesla Autopilot does not require attention. We have always made that extremely clear. Repeatedly. You can’t even turn it on without acknowledging that it requires a supervision. We remind you of that every time you turn it on to ad nauseam. So this was not a case of setting expectations that the car can simply drive itself in the past and then not meeting those expectations. That is completely untrue\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009\\n',\n",

But several years ago, I came to the conclusion, we’re never gonna really prosecute anyone for using our patents. So let’s just say you can use any Tesla patents for free so I think hopefully that’s helpful to others. But I think the regular car industry, the traditional carmakers will solve electrification. It’s not fundamentally difficult at this point to make electric cars. The thing that I think they may be interested in licensing is Tesla autopilot full self-driving. And I think that would save a lot of lives. And a bit but I think the you know, the regular car industry, the traditional carmakers will solve electrification. It’s not fundamentally difficult at this point to make electric cars. The thing that I think they may be interested in licensing is Tesla Autopilot full self-driving. And I think that would save a lot of lives. But I think we still have\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009to prove ourselves for I don’t know maybe another year or so. And then perhaps there will be some other carmakers who may wish to license Tesla Autopilot. And we’d be very open to that.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: I think the company making the most progress besides Tesla is actually VW which is not a start-up, but could be viewed in some ways as a start-up from an electric vehicle standpoint. So VW is doing the most on the electric vehicle front. I think there will be some very strong companies coming out of China. There’s just a lot of super talented and hardworking people in China that strongly believe in manufacturing. And they won’t just be burning the midnight oil. They’ll be burning the 3am oil. So they won’t even leave the factory type of thing. Whereas in America, people are trying to avoid going to work at all.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: Well, you know, I’ve had some conversations with the Chinese government in recent days, and it’s clear that the lockdowns are being lifted rapidly. So I would not expect this to be a significant issue in the coming weeks. You know, in the past where I was sort of upset with lockdowns is where those lockdowns differentially affected Tesla, but not others. So, in the case of California, and the Bay Area counties, specifically every other car factory in North America was allowed to start but not Tesla even though there was no basis for that. It was simply because we were located in Alameda County in California. But they had no rationale. It was arbitrary and unfair. And, you know, that’s the reason for why we’re quite upset about kind of Tesla being singled out as the only car company in America that wasn’t allowed to start even though I think our healthcare practices are probably better than anyone else.\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: I think they’re sort of separate objectives with different shareholder bases. And I think that, you know, I don’t see a tonne of merit in combining them. At times, there are people you know, where we have some say very talented people who actually are willing to join but they want to do things both at SpaceX and Tesla. So for example, we’ve got one of the best Advanced Materials teams in the world. It might be the best but it’s certainly one of the best and a lot of people in that team were willing to join but only if they could work on both rockets and cars.\\n',\n",

If, you know adding roads just increases traffic, why don’t we delete them and decrease traffic, and I think you’d have an uproar if you did that. But the real problem is that we have not. If you take say, congested cities, which really almost all large cities are congested. You have a fundamental dimensional problem. You have, say these tall buildings or multi level buildings, where you’ve got you know, people you know, living in 3D, and then you want to take them in and out of those buildings on a 2D road network. Like how would you possibly expect that to work, especially if they want to all, you know, arrive and depart at roughly the same time?\\n',\n",
              " 'EM: I like the idea of VTOLs but you know, we already have the VTOLs in the form of a helicopter. But the problem with going 3D in the air is that you now have things that make a lot of noise and the wind force that they generate when taking off or landing is very high. I mean, if you just say like look at a little drone, and say now imagine that thing was big. What a racket it would make and how much wind force would it generate and then now they’re going all over the place like a giant beehive of super noisy bees. I don’t think that’s what people want and most of these helicopters are actually banned except for emergency purposes because of this reason.\\n',\n",

And like I said, the best way to assess this is to be in our beta programme or look at the videos of those who are in the beta programme and look at the progress that has occurred and the progress is dramatic. And I’m confident we will not really get to the safety level of human will get far in excess of the safety level of human. So I think ultimately probably a factor of 10 safer than a human as measured by the probability of injury.'},\n",
